<p>Hi, my name is Jacques. I'm quite a polyvalent student ! After studying human resources and project management at University, I decided to start over a new cursus to specialize in web development.</p>
<p>I am a curious and open minded person, always eager to learn. I like the idea that life is a journey, and I hope to complete mine with loads of different and passionating experiences !</p>
<p>The next step for me is to increase my knowledge, skills and work experience by working on challenging (and ratherly international) projects. Can't wait to start !</p>
